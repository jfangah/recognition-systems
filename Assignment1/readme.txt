csit5410_assign1.m 		main program

The main program has the following five functions£º
1.read and save image
2.Compute a binary edge image by Prewitt operator given a fixed threshold value.
3.Compute a binary edge image by Prewitt operator with a self-adapted threshold value.
4.Find the longest line segment in the binary edge image based on Hough transform using mylineextraction(f) where f is the output from TASK 3 (¡°03binary2.jpg¡±).
5.Image alignment using SIFT.
